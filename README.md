Cool board for Atmega328(or similar). Helps fast flush without soldering
♦️Board for fast firmware of Atmel ATMega328 and similar microcontrollers(TQFP-32). 
♦️A 16MHz crystal is installed on the board, which, if necessary, can be replaced with an 8MHz one.
♦️Additionally, the micro legs are duplicated in 2 rows, so if necessary, you can test the code directly on the board without soldering the microcontroller.
♦️Programming is possible via USBASP-ISP, and there are a 3*2 and 5*2 block (if the adapter is not available)
